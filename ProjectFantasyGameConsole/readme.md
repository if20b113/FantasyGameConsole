# Dev manual (os:windows)

## programming/dev
to add new source files
-> run script "DEV_cmake_build.bat"
    - the "build" dir has to be updated everytime a new .cpp file (to be compiled) is added.
        this is done automatically by "DEV_cmake_build.bat"

    - you DONT have to run the script when adding header files (.h / .hpp) ONLY source files
